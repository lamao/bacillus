# bacillus

### Ideas

- Size and energy. Size is defines max energy, attack power, production capacity, 
  reproduction (cell split during reproduction). Energy is used to move
- Use HSL color schema
- Cell produce one substance. And it can consume substance from adjacent positions 
- Minerals are not-living items. When cell dies it becomes organic mineral. Mineral 
  can't consume, produce, move or grow. It just exists.
- Substance may be poison for a bacillus. 
- Each bacillus has N DNA points that may be used to tweak its default genome. 
  Point is spent to make some trait stronger and may be gained when make some
  trait weaker. No points are spent to alter trait. E.g. changing body substance 
  requires 0 points. Add on consumable substance requires 1 point. 1 point may be
  gained if one extra substance becomes a poison to the bacillus
